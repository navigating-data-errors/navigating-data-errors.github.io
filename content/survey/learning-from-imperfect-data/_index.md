summary: |
    Once we identify the most impactful data errors, a natural inclination is to repair all of them. However, in practice, this can be prohibitively expensive and can introduce new errors while giving the false impression that data quality issues have been resolved. Therefore, each data error is fundamentally a source of uncertainty over the space of possible repairs. This part of the tutorial reviews methods for reasoning about reliability of ML models in the presence of this uncertainty.

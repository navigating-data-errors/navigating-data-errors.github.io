summary: |
    Most data errors are buried deep inside vast piles of data and are often hard to distinguish from normal data. Furthermore, not all of them have the same negative impact on the quality of downstream predictive queries. In this part of the tutorial, we introduce data attribution as a framework for reasoning about the importance of individual data points. We go over some prominent approaches for identifying data errors and discuss their main benefits and shortcomings.
